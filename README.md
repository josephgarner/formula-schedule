# Formula Schedule | IoT Bash

Formula Schedule is a fun little side project with the entention of exploring the relationship between E-Ink displays and ESP32 modules.

### Aim
Create a dynamic Formula 1 schedule that can sit in my office and update a display with the upcoming F1 race details. This came about due to the fact that there are F1 races all over the world and keeping track of the timezones can be confusing and annoying.

#### Display Concept
